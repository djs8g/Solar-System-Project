I would like to create a realistic 3d python model of the solar system including the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. This model should use realistic gravitational forces between all of the bodies as they traverse around the Sun. In addition, realistic masses, distances from the Sun, orbital periods, orbital perihelion and aphelion values, orbital inclinations, and orbital eccentricities should be used. These values are provided below from NASA's website. The starting points for each planet's orbit should be randomized so that the planets do not all start from the same x position. The 3D matplotlib plot should show the orbital paths using a dot to represent each object's current location and a line for the previous positions of each object's path. A 2D plot using matplotlib is also requested, which should show each planet (and the Sun) as a different color dot at the ending point of the simulation, with the previous paths as lines around teh posiiotn of the Sun.

# Distance from Sun (km) - This is the average distance from the planet to the Sun in kilometers, also known as the semi-major axis.

# Obliquity to Orbit (degrees) - The angle in degrees the axis of a planet (the imaginary line running through the center of the planet from the north to south poles) is tilted relative to a line perpendicular to the planet's orbit around the Sun, north pole defined by right hand rule. Note: Venus rotates in a retrograde direction, opposite the other planets, so the tilt is almost 180 degrees, it is considered to be spinning with its "top", or north pole pointing "downward" (southward). Uranus rotates almost on its side relative to the orbit, Pluto is pointing slightly "down". The ratios with Earth refer to the axis without reference to north or south.
